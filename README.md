A program that tracks your curser with simulated eye movement. An Exercise meant to test our ability to manipulate a grid structure and replicate a moving eye with HTML, Javascript, and CSS. 

## How to Run

1. Download index.html, eyes.js, and styles.css into a single file onto your machine. 
2. Drag and Drop index.html onto your browswer. 
3. It should load in the eyes, and they will follow your curser. 

## Future Updates
* Add Eyes for a more Monstery effect.
* Change iris and scelera colors.
* Add a menu to change how many eyes and what colors are available for more fun and interaction
